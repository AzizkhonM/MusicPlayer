Traffic dies while we are racin' home
Melted lights cover the open road
I hope we make it
'cause I've been chasing another odyssey
Oh

I can't wait to see your face
Crash when we're switchin' lanes
My love's beyond the pain
But if I miss the brake, we're dancin' in the flames
It's indescribable
Ooh, yeah

"The world can't heal, " they say on the radio, oh no
So grab the wheel, want you to be in control
We're dodgin' headlights, and you say hold tight
Another odyssey, oh

I can't wait to see your face
Crash when we're switching lanes
My love's beyond the pain
But if I miss the brake, we're dancin' in the flames
It's indescribable

Ooh (indescribable)
Ooh

Everything's faded, we barely made it
The fire's raging, but you're still beautiful
And it's amazing 'cause I can taste it
Our final odyssey, ooh

I can't wait to see your face
Crash when we're switching lanes
My love's beyond the pain
But if I miss the brake, we're dancin' in the flames (dancin' in the flames)
So just have faith (just have faith)
We'll never be the same
It's indescribable

Ooh (indescribable)
Oh, yeah, ooh
(Indescribable)
